This may be desirable when using color lookup tables (e.g., LookTable) or tone curves in camera profiles to perform a fixed, consistent level of black subtraction."	"DNG spec (1.4, 2012), p. 71"	 
51111	C7A7	NewRawImageDigest	"This tag is a modified MD5 digest of the raw image data. It has been updated from the algorithm used to compute the RawImageDigest tag be more multi-processor friendly, and to support lossy compression algorithms. The details of the algorithm used to compute this tag are documented in the Adobe DNG SDK source code."	"DNG spec (1.4, 2012), p. 76"	 
51112	C7A8	RawToPreviewGain	The gain (what number the sample values are multiplied by) between the main raw IFD and the preview IFD containing this tag.	"DNG spec (1.4, 2012), p. 76"	 
51125	C7B5	DefaultUserCrop	"Specifies a default user crop rectangle in relative coordinates. The values must satisfy: 0.0 <= top < bottom <= 1.0; 0.0 <= left < right <= 1.0. The default values of (top = 0, left = 0, bottom = 1, right = 1) correspond exactly to the default crop rectangle (as specified by the DefaultCropOrigin and DefaultCropSize tags)."
